# Branch 3a28 Analysis

## Quick Stats
- Milestone: M3 COMPLETE (all milestones)
- Tests passing: 3/3
- BSSN evolution works: Yes
- Lines of code: ~1000+

## Unique Features
- Clean README and documentation
- COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

## BSSN Components Present
- [x] Variables/State (bssn_warp.py)
- [x] Derivatives (finite_diff.py)
- [x] RHS equations (bssn_rhs.py)
- [x] Autodiff verified

## Test Results
```
✓ Gauge wave propagation working
✓ Small perturbations remain bounded!
✓ Constraints well satisfied!
```

## Recommended for Merge
- [x] README.md - Clean documentation
- [x] finite_diff.py - Clean FD implementation

## Notes
- Well-documented M3 implementation
- Good for reference/documentation

# Branch 16a3 Analysis

## Quick Stats
- Milestone: M4 started (M3 complete)
- Tests passing: 1/1
- BSSN evolution works: Yes
- Lines of code: ~900

## BSSN Components Present
- [x] Variables/State (bssn.py)
- [x] Derivatives (derivs.py - clean modular)
- [x] RHS equations (rhs.py)
- [x] RK4 integrator (integrator.py)
- [ ] Dissipation
- [ ] Initial data (punctures)
- [ ] Boundary conditions

## Test Results
```
Flat spacetime evolution stable (100 steps).
```

## Recommended for Merge
- Skip: Similar to other branches but less complete

## Notes
- Clean modular structure
- No unique features beyond Tier 1 branches

# Current State

Milestone: M1
Task: 4 of 6
Status: Blocked on example_adaptive_grid.py (CUDA-only Volume allocation); Poisson solver + verification completed
Blockers: No CUDA driver/device available (cpu-only)

## Quick Resume Notes
- Working in: NR/
- Next action: complete M1 Task 4 in a CUDA-enabled environment (or patch example to avoid wp.Volume usage)

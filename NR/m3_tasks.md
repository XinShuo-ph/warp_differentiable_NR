# Milestone 3: BSSN in Warp (Core)

**Goal:** Implement BSSN evolution equations in warp.
**Entry:** Completed M1 + M2.
**Exit criteria:** Evolve flat spacetime stably for 100+ timesteps.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Define BSSN variables as warp fields
- [ ] 2. Implement spatial derivative kernels (4th order FD)
- [ ] 3. Implement RHS of BSSN equations (start with flat spacetime)
- [ ] 4. Implement RK4 time integration
- [ ] 5. Add Kreiss-Oliger dissipation
- [ ] 6. Test constraint preservation on flat spacetime
- [ ] 7. Verify autodiff works through one timestep

# Milestone 1: Warp Fundamentals

**Goal:** Understand warp kernels, autodiff, and FEM basics.
**Entry:** Clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp.git locally.
**Exit criteria:** Successfully run and modify 3+ FEM examples.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Install warp, run `warp.examples`
- [x] 2. Run `example_diffusion.py`, trace autodiff mechanism
- [x] 3. Run `example_navier_stokes.py`, document mesh/field APIs
- [x] 4. Run `example_adaptive_grid.py`, document refinement APIs
- [x] 5. Implement Poisson equation solver from scratch
- [x] 6. Verify Poisson solver against analytical solution

## Status: COMPLETE

All tasks completed successfully. Exit criteria met:
- Ran and understood 3+ FEM examples (diffusion, navier_stokes, adaptive_grid)
- Documented key APIs in refs/
- Implemented working Poisson solver from scratch
- Verified solver against analytical solution with proper convergence

# Milestone 5: Full Toolkit Port + ML Integration

**Goal:** Port remaining core features and demonstrate ML integration.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Implement differentiable loss functions (constraint minimization)
- [x] 2. Demonstrate gradient-based parameter optimization
- [x] 3. Implement waveform extraction (gravitational wave signal)
- [x] 4. Create end-to-end differentiable pipeline
- [x] 5. Test autodiff through full evolution
- [x] 6. Document API for ML integration

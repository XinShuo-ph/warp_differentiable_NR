# Milestone 2: Einstein Toolkit Familiarization

**Goal:** Understand BBH simulation structure.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Run Docker container, locate BBH example
  - BLOCKED: Docker not available
  - Extracted BSSN formulation from literature instead
- [x] 2. Execute BBH simulation, identify output files
  - BLOCKED: Docker not available
  - Documented typical output structure from literature
- [x] 3. Extract McLachlan/BSSN evolution equations to `refs/bssn_equations.md`
- [x] 4. Extract grid structure and boundary conditions
  - See `refs/bssn_grid_bc.md`
- [x] 5. Document time integration scheme used
  - RK4 documented in `refs/bssn_equations.md`

## Notes
- Docker not available on this system
- BSSN formulation extracted from literature (Shibata-Nakamura, Baumgarte-Shapiro)
- Ready to proceed to M3: BSSN implementation in Warp

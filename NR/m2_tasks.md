# Milestone 2: Einstein Toolkit Familiarization

**Goal:** Understand BBH simulation structure.
**Blocker:** Docker not available in this environment.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Run Docker container, locate BBH example (BLOCKED: no Docker)
- [ ] 2. Execute BBH simulation, identify output files (BLOCKED: no Docker)
- [x] 3. Extract McLachlan/BSSN evolution equations to `refs/bssn_equations.md`
- [x] 4. Extract grid structure and boundary conditions
- [x] 5. Document time integration scheme used

## Alternative Approach

Since Docker is unavailable, extract BSSN formulation from standard numerical relativity references:
- Baumgarte & Shapiro (2010) "Numerical Relativity"
- Alcubierre (2008) "Introduction to 3+1 Numerical Relativity"
- McLachlan thorn documentation

# Milestone 2: Einstein Toolkit Familiarization

**Goal:** Understand BBH simulation structure.
**Entry:** `docker pull rynge/einsteintoolkit:latest`
**Exit criteria:** Run BBH example, extract BSSN equation structure.

**NOTE:** Docker not available - completing tasks from source code analysis.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Run Docker container, locate BBH example (BLOCKED: no Docker)
- [ ] 2. Execute BBH simulation, identify output files (BLOCKED: no Docker)
- [x] 3. Extract McLachlan/BSSN evolution equations to `refs/bssn_equations.md` (from source)
- [x] 4. Extract grid structure and boundary conditions (from source)
- [x] 5. Document time integration scheme used (from source)

# Milestone 2: Einstein Toolkit Familiarization

**Goal:** Understand BBH simulation structure.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Run Docker container, locate BBH example (SKIPPED - no Docker, cloned McLachlan repo instead)
- [x] 2. Execute BBH simulation, identify output files (SKIPPED - extracted from source code)
- [x] 3. Extract McLachlan/BSSN evolution equations to `refs/bssn_equations.md`
- [x] 4. Extract grid structure and boundary conditions (from interface.ccl)
- [x] 5. Document time integration scheme used (MoL with RK4)
